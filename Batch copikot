Act as a senior Spring Batch + distributed systems reviewer.

Project context:
- Spring Boot + Spring Batch application
- Reads eligible cases from DB
- Fetches questionnaire for each case (DB or service)
- Generates PDF per case
- Sends PDF to external Expo system via SOAP
- Chunk-oriented processing
- Retry/Skip logic configured
- Restartable job with ExecutionContext

Task:
1. Scan the entire project.
2. Identify all external integration points (DB, SOAP, file system, PDF generation, etc.).
3. For each integration point:
   - List realistic negative scenarios that can happen in cloud environments.
   - Explain expected behavior (retry, skip, fail job, rollback, idempotent retry).
   - Identify missing safeguards in current code.
4. Suggest concrete test strategies:
   - Unit tests (mocking)
   - Integration tests (Testcontainers)
   - Cloud failure simulation (timeouts, 5xx, partial writes)
5. Verify restartability behavior:
   - What happens if the pod dies mid-chunk?
   - What happens if SOAP call succeeds but DB write fails?
   - Are we protected from duplicate PDF sending?
6. Output:
   - A structured negative test matrix
   - Missing resilience gaps
   - Recommended improvements
